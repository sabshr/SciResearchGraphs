# About
This is a repository of graphs made using Matplotlib for my 2023-2024 Science Research Project on the Synthesis, Characterization, and Viability of Beta-Cyclodextrin crosslinked PVA Hydrogels. This project was associated with Charles Wright Academy in Tacoma, WA.

# Procedure
This is a copy of the notes/procedure I created and used in the synthesis and testing of Beta-Cyclodextrin Crosslinked PVA Hydrogels. I am publishing this documentation to the world in the hope that other students may base their procedures on my method. The method I used certainly wasn't perfect, but it worked for me. The data in this repo may come in handy to some researchers, too!  
<br>
A couple of acronyms that are used throughout the procedure:  
PVA: Polyvinyl Alcohol  
CA: Citric Acid  
B-CD: Beta Cyclodextrin

These may be a bit redundant, but going to this level of detail helped me be organized and operate more efficiently when working in the lab.

### PVA + CA Hydrogel (Control)  
- 15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O  
- Stir at 70-80C for 3h then at 40-50C overnight (~18h)  
- Placed solution under vacuum to remove air bubbles  
- Add 10mL of 0.10M CA  
- Transfer solution into molds (I used Petri dishes. If I were to do this project again, I would use a silicone/more flexible mold.)  
- Place in a 100C oven for 12h  

### PVA/B-CD(4:1) + CA Hydrogel
- 15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O  
- Add 3.75g B-CD to reach a PVA/B-CD weight ratio of 4:1  
- Stir at 70-80C for 3h then at 40-50C overnight (~18h)  
- Placed solution under vacuum to remove air bubbles  
- Add 10mL of 0.10M CA

<summary>Swelling Analysis</summary>  
<br>
- Cut each gel into smaller and record the weight of dried gels<br>
- Place gels in dH2O (I used cell culture wells) and let sit for 24hrs  <br>
- Dry off excess water from the surface  <br>
- Weigh, then calculate swelling using the formula $S = \dfrac{(W_f\ -W_0)}{W_0}\cdot100$

<br><br>

### Preparing Standard Curves
Prepare 4 solutions of known molarity solutions for each dye - Compare to Beer’s law curve (determine the error between actual molarity and estimated molarity on Beer’s law curve)<br>
| Dilution | Congo Red Abs. @498.8nm | Methylene Blue Abs. @668.5nm | Crystal Violet Abs. @590.6nm |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
|  2+8H2O  |          0.320          |             0.156            |             0.360            | 
|  4+6H2O  |          0.627          |             0.376            |             0.738            | 
|  6+4H2O  |          0.902          |             0.530            |             1.099            | 
|  8+2H2O  |          1.145          |             0.640            |             1.367            | 

<br>Gels were placed in a 6-well plate, with wells filled with a 4-6H2O dilution of each dye. 3 plates were used, one for each dye.

|  PVA/B-CD(4:1) + CA  |          0.31         |       0.30            |             0.29           | 
|  PVA/B-CD(2:1) + CA  |          0.33          |             0.31            |             0.31            | 

### Results
- Gels vs No Gel: All gels significantly reduce the absorbance of the dyes compared to no gel, indicating effective dye absorption by the gels.
- PVA + CA: Generally shows good absorption for all dyes, particularly effective for Methylene Blue.
- PVA/B-CD: Shows strong absorption for Congo Red and Crystal Violet but less effective for Methylene Blue compared to PVA + CA.
- PVA/B-CD(4:1) + CA and PVA/B-CD(2:1) + CA: The ratio of B-CD influences the absorbance:
- For Congo Red: PVA/B-CD(4:1) + CA is most effective.
- For Methylene Blue: Lower ratios (or no ratio) of B-CD (PVA + CA) are more effective.
- For Crystal Violet: PVA/B-CD without CA is most effective.
- The weight increase among Cyclodextrin Hydrogels is pretty consistently above that of PVA + CA
