# About
This is a repository of graphs made using Matplotlib for my 2023-2024 Science Research Project on the Synthesis, Characterization, and Viability of Beta-Cyclodextrin crosslinked PVA Hydrogels. This project was associated with Charles Wright Academy in Tacoma, WA.

# Procedure
This is a copy of the notes/procedure I created and used in the synthesis of Beta-Cyclodextrin Crosslinked PVA Hydrogels. This documentation is published to the world in the hope that other students may base their procedures by the wat I did things. The method I used certainly wasn't perfect, but it worked for me. The data in this repo may come in handy to some researchers too!  
<br>
A couple of acronyms that are used throughout the procedure:  
PVA: Polyvinyl Alcohol  
CA: Citric Acid  
B-CD: Beta Cyclodextrin

These may be a bit redundant, but going to this level of detail helped me be organized and operate more efficiently when working in the lab.

### PVA + CA Hydrogel (Control)  
- 15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O  
- Stir at 70-80C for 3h then at 40-50C overnight (~18h)  
- Placed solution under vacuum to remove air bubbles  
- Add 10mL of 0.10M CA  
- Transfer solution into molds (I used Petri dishes. If I were to do this project again, I would use a silicone/more flexible mold.)  
- Place in a 100C oven for 12h  

### PVA/B-CD(4:1) + CA Hydrogel
- 15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O  
- Add 3.75g B-CD to reach a PVA/B-CD weight ratio of 4:1  
- Stir at 70-80C for 3h then at 40-50C overnight (~18h)  
- Placed solution under vacuum to remove air bubbles  
- Add 10mL of 0.10M CA  
- Transfer solution into molds  
- Place in a 100C oven for 12h  

### PVA/B-CD(2:1) + CA Hydrogel
- 15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O  
- Add 7g B-CD to reach a PVA/B-CD weight ratio of 4:1  
- Stir at 70-80C for 3h then at 40-50C overnight (~18h)  
- Placed solution under vacuum to remove air bubbles  
- Add 10mL of 0.10M CA  
- Transfer solution into molds  
- Place in a 100C oven for 12h  


### PVA/B-CD(4:1) Hydrogel 
- Add 15.00g PVA to 100mL dH2O  
- Add 3.75g B-CD to reach a PVA/B-CD weight ratio of 4:1  
- Stir at 70-80C for 3h then at 40-50C overnight (~18h)  
- Placed solution under vacuum to remove air bubbles  
- Transfer solution into molds  
- Place in a 100C oven for 12h

<summary>Swelling Analysis</summary>  
<br>
- Cut each gel into smaller and record the weight of dried gels<br>
- Place gels in dH2O (I used cell culture wells) and let sit for 24hrs  <br>
- Dry off excess water from the surface  <br>
- Weigh, then calculate swelling using the formula $S = \dfrac{(W_f\ -W_0)}{W_0}\cdot100$

Prepare 4 solutions of known molarity solutions for each dye - Compare to Beer’s law curve (determine the error between actual molarity and estimated molarity on Beer’s law curve)
