# About
This is a repository of graphs made using matplotlib for my 2023-2024 Science Research Project on the Synthesis, Characterization, and Viability of Beta-Cyclodextrin crosslinked PVA Hydrogels. This project was associated with Charles Wright Academy in Tacoma, WA.

# Procedure
This is an copy of the notes/procedure I created and used in synthesis of Beta-Cyclodextrin Crosslinked PVA Hydrogels. These are published to the world in the hope that other students may base their procedure off the structure of mine. The method I used certainly isn't perfect, but it worked for me. The data/documentation in this repo may come in handy to some researchers too!  
<br>
A couple acronyms that are used throuought the procedure:  
PVA: Polyvinyl Alcohol  
CA: Citric Acid  
B-CD: Beta Cyclodextrin

*These may be a bit redundant, but going to this level of detail helped me be organized and operate more efficiently when working in the lab.*

### PVA + CA Hydrogel (Control)  
15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O  
Stir at 70-80C for 3h then at 40-50C overnight (~18h)  
Placed solution under vacuum to remove air bubbles  
Add 10mL of 0.10M CA  
Transfer solution into molds (I used petri dishes. If I were to do this project again, I would use a silicone/more flexible mold.)  
Place in 100C oven for 12h  

### PVA/B-CD(4:1) + CA Hydrogel
15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O  
Add 3.75g B-CD to reach a PVA/B-CD weight ratio of 4:1  
Stir at 70-80C for 3h then at 40-50C overnight (~18h)  
Placed solution under vacuum to remove air bubbles  
Add 10mL of 0.10M CA  
Transfer solution into molds  
Place in 100C oven for 12h  

### PVA/B-CD(2:1) + CA Hydrogel
15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O  
Add 7g B-CD to reach a PVA/B-CD weight ratio of 4:1  
Stir at 70-80C for 3h then at 40-50C overnight (~18h)  
Placed solution under vacuum to remove air bubbles  
Add 10mL of 0.10M CA  
Transfer solution into molds  
Place in 100C oven for 12h  


### PVA/B-CD(4:1) Hydrogel 
Add 15.00g PVA to 100mL dH2O  
Add 3.75g B-CD to reach a PVA/B-CD weight ratio of 4:1  
Stir at 70-80C for 3h then at 40-50C overnight (~18h)  
Placed solution under vacuum to remove air bubbles  
Transfer solution into molds  
Place in 100C oven for 12h
