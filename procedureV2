# Synthesis of Hydrogels (Chemical Crosslinking)
*Ignoring previous trials with freeze-thaw method*
100mL 0.10M Citric Acid Solution made with 1.923g CA in H2O.

PVA-CA Hydrogel (Control)
Add 15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O 
Stir at 70C for 3h then at room temp for 48h
Prepare and add 10mL of 0.10M CA 
Transfer solution into molds
Place in 110C oven for 12h

PVA-CA-(B-CD) Hydrogel (4:1) 
Add 15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O 
Add 3.75g B-CD to reach a PVA-CD weight ratio of 4:1
Prepare and add 10mL of 0.10M CA 
Transfer solution into molds
Place in 110C oven for 12h

PVA-CA-(B-CD) Hydrogel (2:1)
Add 15.00g PVA to 90mL dH2O
Add 7.5g B-CD to reach a PVA-CD weight ratio of 2:1
Transfer solution into molds
Place in 110C oven for 12h

PVA-(B-CD) Hydrogel (4:1)
Add 15.00g PVA to 100mL dH2O
Add 3.75g B-CD to reach a PVA-CD weight ratio of 4:1
Transfer solution into molds
Place in 110C oven for 12h

After each gel has been synthesized, weigh, log, and then place in 50C dH2O for 48h to isolate the gel and remove excess PVA. Record gel yields using: Gel % = (Wf/Wi)*100

## Timeline
15.00g PVA Weighed into each beaker
3.75g B-CD Added to 4:1 PVA/CA/BCD
3.75g B-CD Added to PVA/BCD
7.50g B-CD Added to 2:1 PVA/CA/BCD
90.1mL H2O in 2:1 PVA/CA/BCD
90.0mL H2O in 4:1 PVA/CA/BCD
90.1 mL H2O in PVA/CA
Stirred for 4h @ 70-80C (occasionally heated to 90C in intervals to exceed glass transition temperature, but only temporarily)
Placed under Vacuum to remove bubbles
Stirred overnight (20h) @ 50C
10mL CA added to solutions 
Placed in petri dishes and put in 100C oven for 18h (remove at 9:00!!!)
